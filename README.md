# JusticeMatters-Addiction

This project is dedicated to seeking justice and support for families who have lost loved ones to addiction and related mental health struggles. We believe that no life should be lost to these preventable tragedies, and we are committed to raising awareness, providing resources, and advocating for systemic change.

Our mission is rooted in compassion and understanding. We recognize that addiction is a disease, not a moral failing, and that those affected—both the individuals struggling and their families—deserve dignity, respect, and access to proper care and legal recourse when negligence or misconduct occurs.

## Resources

- **[Daily Grief Coping Skills (Medication-Free)](./DAILY_GRIEF_COPING_SKILLS.md)**: A practical guide to daily, evidence-based coping strategies for grief that do not require medication—including grounding exercises, journaling, movement, creative expression, community connection, and more.

## Why This Matters

- **Awareness**: Many families suffer in silence, unaware of their rights or the resources available to them.
- **Resources**: Access to support groups, counseling, and legal aid can make a crucial difference in the healing process.
- **Advocacy**: We work to highlight systemic issues in healthcare, criminal justice, and social services that contribute to preventable deaths.
- **Legal Support**: Families deserve justice when loved ones receive improper care, are given substances different from what was prescribed, or are victims of negligence.
- **Prevention**: By sharing stories and data, we aim to prevent future tragedies and improve care standards.

## How to Help / Get Involved

We welcome support from anyone who shares our mission. Here are ways you can contribute:

- **Share Resources**: Help us compile helpful information about addiction support, mental health services, and legal aid.
- **Donate**: Financial contributions help us maintain this project and support affected families (donation information coming soon).
- **Volunteer**: Offer your time and expertise to help families navigate difficult situations.
- **Report Relevant Data**: Share statistics, research, or case studies that highlight the scope of this crisis.
