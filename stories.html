                                <p>We are seeking justice because no family should go through this pain. Michael's life mattered, and we won't stop fighting until those responsible are held accountable.</p>

                                <p>I share her story so others know they're not alone in this fight. Together, we can demand accountability and prevent more families from experiencing this devastating loss.</p>
